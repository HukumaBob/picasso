## Introduction
Picasso Test Project is a Django-based web application that provides a file upload and processing feature. It uses Django REST framework for creating APIs and Celery for asynchronous file processing.

## Features
- File upload and processing.
- List all uploaded files with their processing status.
- Docker-compose setup for easy deployment.
- Asynchronous file processing with Celery.
- RESTful API endpoints.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Set up the database and apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
5. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

## Usage
- Access the web application at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Use the provided API endpoints for file upload and listing.
- Check the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section for more details.

## API Endpoints
- File Upload: `POST /api/upload/`
- List All Files: `GET /api/files/`

## Async File Processing
- File processing is done asynchronously using Celery.
- Uploaded files are queued for processing.
- The processing status is updated when complete.
